## About the website

This website is a study of how to use JavaScript with Embedded JavaScript templates (EJS) to create websites. The website is written in JavaScript to call EJS files.

## How to use and what you need

* The index.js file uses two main libraries:
   * Express: a library that opens the server
   * BodyParser: a library that stores user input

* To try out the website, you will need the following:
   * Node.js
   * Node Package Manager (NPM)

## Basic usage
1. After installing Node.js, open a terminal and install NPM using the command `npm i`.
2. Start the server using the command `node index.js.` If the server starts successfully, you will see the message "Server running on port 3000".
3. After starting the server, access the website at the URL `http://localhost:3000/`.
4. To close the server, press `Ctrl+C`.
